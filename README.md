_Cold Blood_
===============

Final project for CSTUY SHIP (summer 2014).

_Cold Blood_ is a simple 2-D shooter game for the Processing environment. It is set in the Arctic and based on a hypothetical World War III scenario (NATO vs. Russia).

It was originally titled _Cold Response_ after [a military training exercise](http://mil.no/excercises/coldresponse/Pages/default.aspx) done by the Norwegian Armed Forces in 2014, because they were s**t-scared by the possibility of war with the Soviets.
