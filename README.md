_Cold Response_
===============

Final project for CSTUY SHIP (summer 2014).

_Cold Response_ is a simple 2-D shooter game for the Processing environment. It is set in the Arctic and based on a hypothetical World War III scenario (NATO vs. Russia). _Cold Response_ is named after [an actual military exercise](http://mil.no/excercises/coldresponse/Pages/default.aspx) done by the Norwegian Armed Forces in 2014.
